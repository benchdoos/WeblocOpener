## What is `.webloc` file?
`.webloc` extension is usually means that in front of you is a MacOS Safari web-url. 
Actually it is a text document, formated to property list - PLIST 1.0  ([see](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html)).
You can open it with any text-editor (like notepad on Windows) to find out the url, saved in `.webloc` file.
